# emod-api
Python library/utilities/tools for interacting with EMOD input and output files

Developer note: Any .py file in emod_api will be included in the package.

## Documentation

Documentation available at https://docs.idmod.org/projects/emod-api/en/latest/.

To build the documentation locally, do the following:

1. Create and activate a venv.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the repo and enter the following

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    cd docs
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    cd ..
    pip install -e .
    ```

## Dependencies

### Linux

emod-api can use Snappy [de]compression (python-snappy) as necessary if it is installed which requires libdev-snappy (Debian/Ubuntu) or snappy-devel (RedHat/CentOS) on Linux.

Ubuntu: ```[sudo] apt install libdev-snappy```

CentOS: ```[sudo] yum install snappy-devel``` (not yet tested)

## User Stories

Input
- User wants to be able to create a minimal working config.json for any sim type guaranteed to work with a given Eradication binary.
- User wants to be able to create config.json from large static 'defaults' file and small variable parameters-of-interest file.
- User wants to be able to create guaranteed to work campaigns without having to interact with campaign.json files.
- User wants to create a migration file without having to grok our custom binary migration format.
- User wants to be able to create large multi-node demographics files programatically.

Output
- User wants to be able to get post-processed (cleaned up) schema.
- User wants to be able to get data from InsetChart.json without worrying about exact file format of the files.
- User wants to be able to extract data of interest from spatial binary files.
- User wants to be able to work easily with serialization files.
- User wants to be able to work easily with (pending) events.sql file.

## Dev Tips

- To build package: `python setup.py build`

- To build wheel (.whl): `python setup.py bdist_wheel`

- To import package, you can either:
  - Set symlink to built module in build subdirectory
  - do python setup.py install
  - do python setup.py develop

- To install package (fill in actual version number in filename):  
`    pip install dist/emod_api...whl`

- To update the installed package (fill in actual version number in filename):  
`    pip install --upgrade dist/emod_api...whl`

## Capability Wishlist Based on Known Use Cases rather than Systematic Coverage

- Migration files: users should never have to edit migration binary or header files.
- Serialization: Population manipulation, such as adding IPs or adding risk factors.
- Demographics: HINT matrices should not be created directly in demographics.
- Demographics: Population demographic initalization should be easier and reliable.
- Config: param_overrides & w5ml & custom events.

### Running tests

Please see the documentation for [testing](/tests/README.md).
